# Lessons Learned

## Phase 1

### eat365 File Formats
- Sales Summary xlsx has header at row 4 (0-indexed = 3), not row 2. Rows 0-2 are metadata/sub-headers.
- Sales Summary date format is "2026-03-31 (Tue)" — must regex extract the date portion.
- Sales By Item xls has header at row 1. Row 0 is a period label.
- Sales By Item may have duplicate product names — must deduplicate before upsert or Postgres throws "ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE command cannot affect row a second time".
- Transaction Report CSV mixes order-level rows with item-level rows. Must filter by Item Type.
- Hourly Sales has a "Total" row at the end and a "Time" header row that both must be excluded.

### Ocard File Formats
- 會員招募分析 and 顧客消費分析 are NOT tabular CSVs. They are key-value pair format with sections. Must parse by scanning for known key names.
- 儀表板 xlsx has 3 sheets. "明細" sheet has daily data with header at row 2.
- 商品銷售 CSV has phone numbers wrapped in `="..."` Excel quoting. Must strip the wrapper.

### Database
- PostgreSQL does not allow COALESCE() inside UNIQUE constraints. Use CREATE UNIQUE INDEX instead.
- Supabase JS client `.upsert()` onConflict does not support expressions like COALESCE. Use DEFAULT '' on nullable columns and a plain unique index instead.
- When batch upserting, deduplicate input data first — Postgres rejects a batch where two rows match the same conflict target.

### Architecture
- Always upsert (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE) — users may re-upload the same file.
- Return structured error arrays from parsers, never throw exceptions.
- Keep SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY server-side only. Never prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_.

### Deployment (Zeabur)
- Node 22 has npm compatibility issues on Zeabur. Use Node 18 Alpine in Dockerfile.
- Next.js needs `output: 'standalone'` in next.config.mjs for Docker deployment.
- Must have a `public/` directory (even if empty) or Dockerfile COPY fails.
