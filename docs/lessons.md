# Lessons Learned

## Phase 1

### eat365 File Formats
- Sales Summary xlsx has header at row 4 (0-indexed = 3), not row 2. Rows 0-2 are metadata/sub-headers.
- Sales Summary date format is "2026-03-31 (Tue)" — must regex extract the date portion.
- Sales By Item xls has header at row 1. Row 0 is a period label.
- Sales By Item may have duplicate product names — must deduplicate before upsert or Postgres throws "ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE command cannot affect row a second time".
- Transaction Report CSV mixes order-level rows with item-level rows. Must filter by Item Type.
- Hourly Sales has a "Total" row at the end and a "Time" header row that both must be excluded.

### Ocard File Formats
- 會員招募分析 and 顧客消費分析 are NOT tabular CSVs. They are key-value pair format with sections. Must parse by scanning for known key names.
- 儀表板 xlsx has 3 sheets. "明細" sheet has daily data with header at row 2.
- 商品銷售 CSV has phone numbers wrapped in `="..."` Excel quoting. Must strip the wrapper.

### Database
- PostgreSQL does not allow COALESCE() inside UNIQUE constraints. Use CREATE UNIQUE INDEX instead.
- Supabase JS client `.upsert()` onConflict does not support expressions like COALESCE. Use DEFAULT '' on nullable columns and a plain unique index instead.
- When batch upserting, deduplicate input data first — Postgres rejects a batch where two rows match the same conflict target.

### Architecture
- Always upsert (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE) — users may re-upload the same file.
- Return structured error arrays from parsers, never throw exceptions.
- Keep SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY server-side only. Never prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_.

### Deployment (Zeabur)
- Node 22 has npm compatibility issues on Zeabur. Use Node 18 Alpine in Dockerfile.
- Next.js needs `output: 'standalone'` in next.config.mjs for Docker deployment.
- Must have a `public/` directory (even if empty) or Dockerfile COPY fails.

## Phase 2

### Auth
- Supabase Auth `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` requires async cookies() in Next.js 14. The `setAll` callback must be wrapped in try/catch because it can be called from Server Components where cookies are read-only.
- Middleware must refresh the session on every request by calling `supabase.auth.getUser()` — using `getSession()` alone won't refresh expired tokens.

### TypeScript / Build
- Next.js picks up ALL `.ts` files in the project tree for type checking, including agent scripts. Exclude standalone scripts directories (`agents/`, `scripts/`) in `tsconfig.json`.
- `googleapis` GA4 `runReport` expects `limit` as a string, not number.
- Lucide React icons should be typed as `LucideIcon`, not `React.ComponentType`.
- ESLint `no-explicit-any` disable comments must be on the exact line with `any`, not the line before the function declaration.

### Google APIs
- GSC `searchanalytics.query` dimensionFilterGroups with `groupType: 'or'` allows matching multiple brand keywords in one request.
- GA4 dates come as `YYYYMMDD` format from the API — must reformat to `YYYY-MM-DD` before storing.
- Always deduplicate API response rows before upserting — the same query+date or event+page can appear multiple times.

## Phase 3

### AI / Claude API
- Claude API responses may wrap JSON in markdown code fences (```json...```). Must strip fences before parsing.
- Use retry (up to 2 retries) for JSON parse failures — Claude may occasionally return malformed JSON on first attempt.
- Prompt assembly should use pipe-delimited tables for data context — structured enough for Claude to understand, compact enough to fit in context.
- Limit product sales to top 50 and margin matrix to top 40 in prompts to avoid exceeding token limits.

### Recharts TypeScript
- Recharts v3 Tooltip `formatter` prop types are strict. Don't annotate callback parameter types (e.g. `(val: number)`) — use `(val)` and cast with `Number(val)` inside the callback.

### Map Iteration
- `Map.values()` iterator requires `--downlevelIteration` or ES2015+ target in tsconfig. Wrap with `Array.from()` to avoid build errors.
